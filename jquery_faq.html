            <dt class="questions">How old is the National Park System?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park. View the National Park System timeline.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values. Read more about the history of the arrowhead and other elements of NPS visual design.

            <dt class="questions">How many people visit the national parks?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">Total recreation visitors to the national parks in 2016: 330,971,689</dd>

            <dt class="questions">What government agency oversees the National Park Service?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">The National Park Service is a bureau of the Department of the Interior. Directly overseeing its operation is the Department's Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">How many employees are in the National Park Service?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">Permanent, temporary, and seasonal: Approximately 22,000 diverse professionals
                    Volunteers in Parks: nearly 340,000 in 2016
                </dd>

            <dt class="questions">How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">Only 118 of your 417 park sites charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">Where can I find a park map?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">You can view maps on specific park websites or download maps from the Harpers Ferry Center map collection.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit. In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.</dd>

            <dt class="questions">How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as WWII Valor in the Pacific (Pearl Harbor), many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours offered at a specific park, please see the park search.</dd>
